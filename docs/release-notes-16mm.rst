Introduction
------------

The major `changes to GroupServer`_ in the Pastis release include
a new email-settings page. You can `get Pastis`_ immediately.

Changes to GroupServer
----------------------

The `Email-settings page`_ is now easier to use with mobile
phones. The other major update in this release is the `updated
base packages`_. Finally, there have been some `minor
improvements`_.

Email-settings page
===================

The email-settings page allows people to add email addresses, and
set which addresses they prefer. The page has been updated so it
is easier to use with mobile devices, with buttons allowing
people to add and remove addresses from the list of
addresses. Using drag-and-drop between the lists still works for
those on desktop systems.

The underlying code now uses web-hooks and JSON to update the
email settings. This results in a far-faster page than before.

Finally, the dependencies on jQuery.UI and Twitter Bootstrap have
been removed.

Updated base packages
=====================

The Zope2_ application framework, which makes up GroupServer, has
been updated to version 2.13.23 from 2.13.22. The buildout_
system, which controls most of the installation and update
process, has been updated to use `zc.buildout 2.3.1`_.

In addition packages such as dnspython_, lxml_, Pillow_,
premailer_, pytz_ and requests_ have also been updated.

.. _Zope2: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Zope2
.. _buildout: http://www.buildout.org/en/latest/
.. _zc.buildout 2.3.1:
   https://pypi.python.org/pypi/zc.buildout/2.3.1
.. _dnspython: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/dnspython
.. _premailer: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/premailer
.. _Pillow: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Pillow
.. _premailer: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/premailer
.. _requests: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/requests
.. _lxml: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/lxml
.. _pytz: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pytz

Minor improvements
==================

* The code that determines if someone **can post** has been
  updated so it is more thoroughly tested.

* All the unit-tests now can be run by the script generated by
  `zc.recipe.testrunner`_::

    $ ./bin/testrunner -v -c -m "gs\..*"

* The image-scaling code now handles some errors in a more robust
  way.

    existing GroupServer installation:
