Introduction
------------

Of the visible `changes to GroupServer`_ in the Pastis release
the most significant is the new Change email settings page. You
can `get Pastis`_ immediately.

----------------------
Changes to GroupServer
----------------------

The `Email-settings page`_ is now easier to use with mobile
phones. The other major update in this release is the `updated
base packages`_. Finally, there have been some `minor
improvements`_.

Email-settings page
===================

The Change email settings page allows people to add email addresses, and
set the addresses they prefer. The page has been updated so it is
**easier to use** with mobile devices, with buttons allowing
people to add and remove addresses from each list of
addresses. Using drag-and-drop between the lists still works for
those on desktop systems.

The underlying code now uses web-hooks and JSON to update the
email settings. This results in a far-faster page than before.

Finally, the dependencies that the Change email settings page had
on ``jQuery.UI`` and Twitter Bootstrap have been removed.

Updated base packages
=====================

The most visible dependency to change in Pastis is jQuery_, which
has been updated to version 1.12.0, from 1.9.1. This should be
compatible with any customisation code that exists for
GroupServer, as the API for jQuery remains the same. Following
the change to jQuery, the WYMeditor_ has also been updated to
1.1.1, from 1.0.0b5.

The Zope2_ application framework, which supports GroupServer, has
been updated to version 2.13.23 from 2.13.22. The buildout_
system, which controls most of the installation and update
process, has been updated to use `zc.buildout 2.3.1`_.

In addition packages such as dnspython_, enum34_, lxml_,
premailer_, pytz_, Pillow_, requests_, and six_ have also been
updated.

Minor improvements
==================

* The **Admin** section of the group page has been moved up, so
  it stays in once place while the dynamic *Members* and *Recent
  files* sections load.

* The code that determines if someone **can post** has been
  updated so it is more thoroughly tested.

* The code that provides the **image scaling** now handles some
  errors in a more robust way.

* The **installation script** :program:`gs_install_ubuntu.sh` now
  uses bold and muted text to make the information hierarchy more
  clear.

* The **German translation** has been updated, thanks to Alice
  and `Stephan G. Blendinger`_.

* More **unit tests** have been added to the products that make
  up GroupServer

* All the unit-tests now can be run by the script generated by
  `zc.recipe.testrunner`_::

    $ ./bin/testrunner -v -c -m "gs\..*"

  This script is run by the new **continuous integration** system
  provided by `Travis CI`_.

* More JavaScript has been switched to use *strict mode.* This
  includes the code that supports **Registration.**

GroupServer to Pastis (16.mm) carry out the following steps.

#.  Copy the new versions of the configuration files to your
    existing GroupServer installation:

      ::

        $ cp ../groupserver-16.mm/[bivz]*cfg  .

#.  Run ``buildout`` in your existing GroupServer installation:

      ::

#.  Restart your GroupServer instance (see
    :doc:`groupserver-start`).
