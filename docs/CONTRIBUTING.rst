Discuss
=======

**Tell others** about GroupServer using your social
networks. `Tweet at @GroupServer
<https://twitter.com/groupserver>`_ to share the love.

Advise

Running a mailing list manager is a new experience for many. Many
issues — like :doc:`running proxies <proxy-configure>`,
:doc:`running a mail-transfer agent <postfix-configure>` and
running a relational database — have little to with GroupServer
specifically. **Join** `GroupServer Development`_ and give advice
to others about how to run GroupServer.
