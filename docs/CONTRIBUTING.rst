Make GroupServer better: learn_, discuss_, advise_, translate_,
and document_ without touching any code, but you can code_ as
well!

.. index:: !Local expert

Learn
=====

The first step to contributing to GroupServer is to **use
GroupServer** as a normal group member:

* Join groups
* Read and post using email and the web
* Search topics and posts
* Link to topics and posts
* Update your profile

Become the *local expert* and help others make the most of
GroupServer. You can then look for the opportunity to
**administer** a group and site:

* Invite and add people
* Make topics sticky
* Manage the members of a group
* Change the group privacy to public, private, or secret
* Start announcement, discussion, and support groups

.. index:: !Twitter

Discuss
=======

**Tell others about GroupServer** using your social
networks. `Tweet at @GroupServer
<https://twitter.com/groupserver>`_ to share the love. Join
`GroupServer Development`_ and discuss how to make GroupServer
more awesome.

Translate
=========

**Add** to a translation, or **start** a translation team for a
new language using Transifex_, which is at the core of the
internationalisation effort for GroupServer. (Currently there are
translations for English, French, and German.)

Advise
======

**Join** `GroupServer Development`_ and give advice to others
about how to run GroupServer. Running a mailing list manager is a
new experience for many, but the issues — like :doc:`running
proxies <proxy-configure>`, :doc:`running a mail-transfer agent
<postfix-configure>` and running a relational database — can be
solved by people with general system-administration experience.

.. index:: Documentation, reStructuredText

Document
========

**Post** changes to the documentation in `GroupServer
Development`_, or **change** `the docs on GitHub`_. (The
documentation for GroupServer is written in reStructuredText_ — a
plain-text format that is a lot like a wiki.)

.. index:: Development

Code
====

There are many layers of code in GroupServer, and you can
contribute to any and all of them:

* **HTML** is used for the pages, and the notifications,
* **JavaScript** is used to provide the dynamic elements,
* **CSS** is provides the styling,
* **Python** does the hard work, and
* **SQL** deals with the data.

**Read** :doc:`the development guide <development>` and
**discuss** your changes in `GroupServer Development`_.
