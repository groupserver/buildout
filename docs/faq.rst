.. index::
   triple: Group; Member; Moderate

... make all the members of a group moderated?
  Ideally you would change the moderation of a group to *Moderate
  specified members, and all new members that join this group*
  before the new members are added. However, if this was skipped,
  and a large number of people has been added, then it is
  possible to set the list of moderated members.

  #. Visit the :file:`/groupserver/` folder in the
     :ref:`ZMI <ZMI Login>`.
  #. Open the ``acl_users`` object.
  #. Select the *User groups* tab.
  #. Open the user-group.
  #. Copy the list of user-identifiers from the *Users* list into
     a text editor.
  #. Remove the identifiers for each the administrator and
     moderator.
  #. Visit the :file:`/groupserver/ListManager` folder in the
     ZMI.
  #. Open the mailing list object for the group.
  #. Copy the list of members to be moderated from the text
     editor into the ``moderated_members`` list.
  #. Click the *Save changes* button.

.. index::
   pair: User; Delete
   pair: Profile; Delete

... remove a user?
  When a person leaves the last group on their site they are no
  longer a site member, but they will still have a
  user-object. These objects can be deleted, but it is
  discouraged.

  #. Visit the :file:`/groupserver/` folder in the
     :ref:`ZMI <ZMI Login>`,
  #. Open the ``acl_users`` object,
  #. Select the user-object to delete, and
  #. Click the ``Delete`` button.

.. index::
   pair: Email; Virus scan

... scan for viruses?
  Install `pyClamd. <http://xael.org/pages/pyclamd-en.html>`_

.. index:: Support
   pair: Group; Support

... set multiple people to receive the support email?
  The easiest way for multiple people to receive messages to the
  Support email address is to create a new *Support group*.

  #. Start a *secret* group.
  #. Change the *group* *type* to *Support*.
  #. Add the people who need to receive the messages to support
     to the group.
  #. :ref:`Change the support email address <changeSupport>` to
     the email address of the new group.

.. index::
   pair: Email; Hide
   pair: Profile; Password

... turn off a feature?
  Normally the easiest way to turn off a feature is to hide it in
  the CSS.

  #. Get used to :ref:`changing the skin. <skin>`
  #. Make your own skin, based off the Blue or Green skin (see
     :doc:`development`).
  #. Hide the interface element in question by setting it to
     ``display: none``.

.. index:: Web page

Why do I see...
---------------

.. index:: Proxy, Web proxy, Postfix
   pair: Configuration; Proxy

...  Request Entity Too Large?
  Email messages are added to GroupServer, by :doc:`postifx,
  <postfix-configure>` using a web-hook. Because of this the
  :doc:`proxy <proxy-configure>` can block a message if it is too
  large.  Adjust the ``client_max_body_size`` parameter in
  :program:`nginx` or similar variable in your proxy of choice.

  <http://groupserver.org/r/post/xXIumIpGyDIKgaifmxuRy>


.. index:: Skin
   pair: Email; Skin

... email messages with the wrong CSS?
  The web-hook that adds a message may use different URL to the
  one used for normal web traffic (see :ref:`skin`). If this is
  the case GroupServer may have to be explicitly told the skin to
  use.

  #. Visit the :file:`/groupserver/` folder in the
     :ref:`ZMI <ZMI Login>`,
  #. Open the ``GlobalConfiguration`` object,
  #. Set the ``emailSkin`` property to the same value that is
     used in the proxy configuration.

.. index:: root!

... so many errors when installing?
  GroupServer can only run as a normal user, never as the
  ``root`` superuser. Change the ownership of the GroupServer
  directory and all of its contents to a normal user.
