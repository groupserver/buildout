   double: Site; Start

.. _startSite:

... create a new site?

  GroupServer can handle more than one site. Each site will have
  its own set of groups, while the profiles will be shared
  between the sites. Sadly, the process is very manual, and prone
  to problems.

  #. Copy the folder for the initial site.

     #. Visit the :file:`/groupserver/Content` folder in the
        :ref:`ZMI <ZMI Login>`.
     #. Select the folder.
     #. Click the :guilabel:`Copy` button.
     #. Click the :guilabel:`Paste` button to paste it into the
        :file:`/groupserver/Content` folder.
     #. Select the new folder.
     #. Click the :guilabel:`Rename` button.
     #. Give the folder a new *unique* name. The new name must be
        unique among the sites, and all the groups.
     #. Click the :guilabel:`Ok` button.

  #. Create a new *user group* for the site.

     #. Visit :file:`/groupserver/acl_users`
     #. Select the :guilabel:`User Groups` tab.
     #. Click the :guilabel:`Add...` button.
     #. Set the :guilabel:`Name` of the new user group to
        ``{site-name}_member``, where ``{site-name}`` is the name
        of your site.
     #. Click the :guilabel:`Add` button.

  #. Update the site configuration.

     #. Update the site title.

        #. Visit the folder for your new site.
        #. Select the :guilabel:`Properties` tab.
        #. Edit the title.
        #. Click the :guilabel:`Ok` button.

     #. Update the URL

        #. Visit the :file:`DivisionConfiguration` in the folder for
           your new site.
        #. Set the following at a minimum.

           * Update ``canonicalHost`` to be the hostname of your
             site.
           * Ensure that ``canonicalPort`` is correct. If this
             site is going to be an HTTP site ``canonicalPort``
             should be ``80``; for HTTPS it should be ``443``
           * Add a new property named ``emailDomain``. This is
             the domain used after the ``@`` in the email
             addresses for the groups on the site. It may be the
             same as ``canonicalHost`` or different.

        #. Click the :guilabel:`Save Changes` button.

  #. Delete the groups.

     #. Visit the :file:`groups` folder in your new site.
     #. Select all the groups.
     #. Click the :guilabel:`Delete` button.

  #. Set the permissions.

     #. Visit the folder for your new site.
     #. Select the :guilabel:`Security` tab.

        * If there is no ``DivisionAdmin`` role listed enter
          ``DivisionAdmin`` into the :guilabel:`User defined
          roles` entry and click :guilabel:`Add Role`
        * If there is no ``DivisionMember`` role listed enter
          ``DivisionMember`` into the :guilabel:`User defined
          roles` entry and click :guilabel:`Add Role`

     #. Click :guilabel:`local roles` at the top of the page.
     #. Set yourself as a site administrator.

        #. Enter your user-identifier (it is the last segment of
           your profile URL, between the ``/`` characters) into the
           :guilabel:`User` entry.
        #. Select :guilabel:`DivisionAdmin` from the
           :guilabel:`Roles` list.
        #. Click the :guilabel:`Add` button.
     #. Set the user-group.

        #. Select the name of the user-group for the site from
           the :guilabel:`Group` list.
        #. Select ``DivisionMember`` from the :guilabel:`Roles`
           list.
        #. Click the :guilabel:`Add` button.

  #. Add :doc:`the proxy configuration <proxy-configure>` for
     your new site.
  #. Add :doc:`the Postfix configuration <postfix-configure>` for
     your new site.

.. index::
   triple: Group; Email address; Change

.. _changeEmail:

... change the email address for a group?
  The email address for a group is normally the group-identifier
  followed by the domain name for the site. However, it can be
  changed:

  #. Open the list object in the :file:`/groupserver/ListManager`
     folder.
  #. Edit the ``mailto`` property to the new value.
  #. Click the *Save changes* button.

  the ZMI.

  #. Log into the :ref:`ZMI <ZMI Login>`.
  #. Visit the file
     :file:`/groupserver/Content/Templates/output/footerlinks.xml`.
  #. Change the contents of the page template to the footer you
     desire. Something like the following:

     .. code-block:: xml

       <ul class="inline-list pull-right">
        <li>Like</li>
        <li>This</li>
       </ul>

  #. Click the :guilabel:`Save Changes` button.

.. index::
   pair: Configuration; Host name

.. _changeHostname:

... change the host name?
  The host-name is normally set during
  :doc:`installation. <groupserver-install>` However, it can be
  changed afterwards.

  #. Visit the :file:`/groupserver/` folder in the
     :ref:`ZMI <ZMI Login>`.
  #. Open the ``GlobalConfiguration`` object.
  #. Edit the ``canonicalHost`` property to the new value.
  #. Click the *Save changes* button.
  #. Visit the :file:`/groupserver/ListManager` folder.
  #. :ref:`Change the email address <changeEmail>` for every
     group in the folder

.. index:: !Support
   pair: Support; Email

.. _changeSupport:

... change the support email?
  The email address for support is first set during the
  :doc:`GroupServer installation. <groupserver-install>` To
  change it

  #. Visit the :file:`/groupserver/` folder in the
     :ref:`ZMI <ZMI Login>`,
  #. Open the ``GlobalConfiguration`` object, and
  #. Edit the ``supportEmail`` property.
  #. Click the *Save changes* button.

.. index:: !Editable page

.. _createPage:

... create a page?
  Some pages in GroupServer (such as ``/about``) are editable.

  #. Visit the folder that should contain the page in the
     :ref:`ZMI <ZMI Login>`.
  #. Add a new folder.
  #. Visit the new folder.
  #. Select the *Interfaces* tab.
  #. Select
     ``Products.GSContentManager.interfaces.IGSContentManagerFolderMarker``
     in the *Available Marker Interfaces* list.
  #. Click the *Add* button.

.. index::
   pair: Email; Delete

.. _deletePost:

... delete a post?
  Once a post has been made then the group members will receive
  an email message containing that post, and there is no way to
  recall the message. However, a post can be hidden in the
  archive: click the :guilabel:`Hide` button next to the
  post. The post will be replaced with a message saying why it
  was deleted.

  To actually delete a post:

  * Any associated files must be removed from the ``file`` table,
  * The ``first_post_id``, ``last_post_id`` and ``num_posts``
    must be updated in the ``topic`` table, and
  * The post itself must be removed from the ``post`` table.

  After deleting a post anyone following a link to the post on
  the archive (from the earlier message) will see a ``404 (Not
  found)`` error rather than the nicer ``410 (Gone)`` error.

.. index:: !DMARC
   pair: Email; DMARC

.. _dmarc:

... disable email address obfuscation?
   You cannot disable this feature. If a person posts from a
   domain controlled by DMARC (:rfc:`7489`) then GroupServer
   rewrites the :mailheader:`From` header so others will receive
   the message. (If this was skipped then the message will fail
   the DMARC check and the group members would never see the
   message.) This conforms to `the draft DMARC interoperability
   specification.`_

   .. _the draft DMARC interoperability specification.:
      https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-dmarc-interoperability-13#section-4.1.1.1

.. index::
   pair: Email; Import

.. _importPosts:

... import posts from another system?
   To import posts from another system first export the posts as
   an ``mbox`` file, then use the :command:`mbox2gs` script to
   import the posts into GroupServer
   `(documentation). <http://groupserver.readthedocs.org/projects/gsgroupmessagesaddmbox2gs/en/latest/>`_

.. index::
   triple: Group; Member; Moderate

.. _allModerated:

... make all the members of a group moderated?
  Ideally you would change the moderation of a group to *Moderate
  specified members, and all new members that join this group*
  before the new members are added. However, if this was skipped,
  and a large number of people has been added, then it is
  possible to set the list of moderated members.

  #. Visit the :file:`/groupserver/` folder in the
     :ref:`ZMI <ZMI Login>`.
  #. Open the ``acl_users`` object.
  #. Select the *User groups* tab.
  #. Open the user-group.
  #. Copy the list of user-identifiers from the *Users* list into
     a text editor.
  #. Remove the identifiers for each the administrator and
     moderator.
  #. Visit the :file:`/groupserver/ListManager` folder in the
     ZMI.
  #. Open the mailing list object for the group.
  #. Copy the list of members to be moderated from the text
     editor into the ``moderated_members`` list.
  #. Click the *Save changes* button.

.. _removeUser:

... remove a user?
  When a person leaves their last group on a site they are no
  longer a site member, but they will still have a
  user-object. These objects can be deleted, but it is
  discouraged.

  #. Visit the :file:`/groupserver/` folder in the
     :ref:`ZMI <ZMI Login>`,
  #. Open the ``acl_users`` object,
  #. Select the user-object to delete, and
  #. Click the ``Delete`` button.

.. _multipleSupport:

... set multiple people to receive the support email?
  The easiest way for multiple people to receive messages to the
  Support email address is to create a new *Support group*.

  #. Start a *secret* group.
  #. Change the *group* *type* to *Support*.
  #. Add the people who need to receive the messages to support
     to the group.

Why do I see...
---------------

.. index::
   pair: Install; CentOS
   pair: Install; PostgreSQL
   pair: Install; RHEL

.. _postgreSQLErrorCentOS:

... an error setting up the database?

   Towards the end of the GroupServer installation process the
   system will try and create some tables. If the permissions for
   :program:`PostgreSQL` are set to ``IDENT`` based
   authentication you will see the following error:

     | psql: FATAL:  Ident authentication failed for user "gsadmin"

   Change the :program:`PostgreSQL` authentication to ``md5``.

   #. Open the file :file:`pg_hba.conf`. (It is normally found
      within :file:`/etc/postgresql`, but the specific location
      depends on your version of :program:`PostgreSQL` and
      distribution.)

   #. Change ``ident`` to ``md5`` in the lines that read::

        host  all  all  127.0.0.1/32  ident
        host  all  all  ::1/128       ident

      They should end up like the following::

        host  all  all  127.0.0.1/32  md5
        host  all  all  ::1/128       md5

   #. Restart :program:`PostgreSQL`.

.. index::
   pair: Install; Distribute

.. _distribute:

... an error with distribute?
  Sometimes there is an issue with installing the ``distribute``
  package:

    | Error: There is a version conflict
    | We already have : distribute 0.6.24

  The solution is

  #. Go to your GroupServer folder,
  #. Get :command:`pip` to install the correct version of
     distribute:

     .. code-block:: console

       $ ./bin/pip install "distribute == 0.6.49"

  #. Carry on installing GroupServer:

     .. code-block:: console

       $ ./gs_install_ubuntu.sh

.. index:: Skin
   pair: Email; Skin

.. _emailCSS:

... email messages with the wrong CSS?
  The web-hook that adds a message may use different URL to the
  one used for normal web traffic (see :ref:`skin`). If this is
  the case GroupServer may have to be explicitly told the skin to
  use.

  #. Visit the :file:`/groupserver/` folder in the
     :ref:`ZMI <ZMI Login>`,
  #. Open the ``GlobalConfiguration`` object,
  #. Set the ``emailSkin`` property to the same value that is
     used in the proxy configuration.

  <http://groupserver.org/r/post/5s9tsZFDKPDHJS1JkunBun>

   pair: Configuration; Proxy

.. _requestEntityTooLarge:

...  Request Entity Too Large?
  Email messages are added to GroupServer, by :doc:`postifx,
  <postfix-configure>` using a web-hook. Because of this the
  :doc:`proxy <proxy-configure>` can block a message if it is too
  large.  Adjust the ``client_max_body_size`` parameter in
  :program:`nginx` or similar variable in your proxy of choice.

  GroupServer can only run as a normal user, never as the
  ``root`` superuser. Change the ownership of the GroupServer
  directory and all of its contents to a normal user.
