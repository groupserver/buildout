Installation can be tricky: much has to be configured and set up
correctly or installation will fail. We wrote this documentation
for people with moderate experience in Linux system
administration. If you get stuck, please ask us questions in
`GroupServer Development`_. Other more detailed guides would be
gratefully accepted.

.. _GroupServer Development: http://groupserver.org/groups/development

.. note:: GroupServer is developed on `Ubuntu`_, and is know to
          run on `CentOS`_. We will gladly accept any
          modifications you have that will make GroupServer run
          on more platforms.

Quick start
===========

#.  Download the latest version of GroupServer from
    <http://groupserver.org/downloads> and extract the archive.

#.  Create a new hostname for your GroupServer site. Yes, you will need
    a new one (see `Pick a Host Name`_).

#.  Edit ``config.cfg`` (see `Configure GroupServer`_).

#.  Enable prepared transaction support in PostgreSQL (see `Configure
    PostgreSQL`_).

#.  Run the following (see `Run the installer`_):

      .. code-block:: console

         $ ./gs_install_ubuntu.sh

#.  `Start Zope`_:

      .. code-block:: console

         $ ./bin/instance fg

#.  Visit your new site.

#.  Commence the `next steps`_.

Set up
======

GroupServer builds on five major infrastructure packages. These
packages are installed by the installation script. However, you
must configure the relationship between GroupServer and to these
packages **before** you `run the installer`_.

* **Postfix** handles both the incoming and outgoing email.
* **Zope** provides the web framework and basic web server support.
* **PostgreSQL** stores the posts.
* **ZODB** stores some web content and the user-information.
* **Redis** provides an application cache.

   :width: 100%
   :alt: The architecture of GroupServer
   :align: center

   GroupServer listens for connections on a single port (8080, by
   default) and serves up either the administration interface
   (ZMI) or the normal web interface depending on the name used
   to connect to the web server (virtual hosting). Email comes
   into the server via the web interface, and goes out using
   SMTP. The data is stored in a variety of locations.

Setting up GroupServer is done in four steps: first `pick a host name`_,
then `configure GroupServer`_, `run the installer`_ to install the
system, and finally `start Zope`_.

.. index:: 
   pair: Configuration; Host name

Pick a host name
----------------

Your new site needs its own hostname. This is the name that
people will use to access your new GroupServer site with a web
browser. For a trial system, the name can be set up in the
:manpage:`hosts(5)` file.

#.  Edit :file:`/etc/hosts` as  the ``root`` user.
#.  Add the new host name to the ``localhost`` entry, which is
    normally the first one. For example, to add the name
    ``gstest`` change the line to the following::

        127.0.0.1    localhost gstest

#. Save the ``hosts`` file.

.. index::
   pair: Configuration; GroupServer

Configure GroupServer
---------------------

The configuration of GroupServer is mostly carried out by
modifying the :file:`config.cfg` file, which is located in the
root of the GroupServer folder [#cfgFile]_. First you must
configure the `GroupServer Site`_ itself. Next the `Zope`_
system, which will run your GroupServer site, needs to be
configured, before the `database storage`_.

.. index::
   pair: Configuration; SMTP
   pair: Email; SMTP

GroupServer site
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You will need to check all the configuration for your initial site.

``host``
  The domain name used by people accessing your new GroupServer
  site. It must be the same as what you picked a host name
  earlier (see `Pick a host name`_).

``admin_email``
  When GroupServer is installed, an example site and group are
  created. So you can use the administration functions you must
  sign in as an administrator. This is the email address of that
  administrator. Posts to the example group will be sent to the
  administrator at this address. This email address **must**
  work.

``admin_password``
  The password of the administrator of the new GroupServer
  site. The password will be used to sign in, and can be changed
  after the site has been created.

``support_email`` The email address where support messages are
  sent, and were email notifications are send from. For testing
  this can be set to your own or the admin email address.

``smtp_host``
  The SMTP host that will be used to send email from
  GroupServer. It defaults to ``localhost``, assuming you will be
  running Postfix on the same machine as GroupServer.

Zope
~~~~

Zope_ is used to provide the web-framework for GroupServer, and a
basic web-server. The server listens for connections on a single
port (the ``zope_port``) and provides the GroupServer UI if
connections are made using the ``host`` name, or the Zope
Management Interface (ZMI) if connections are made with any other
host names.

The ``zope_host`` and ``zope_port`` are probably correct for most
systems, weather you are testing or if you are going to proxy
GroupServer (see :doc:`proxy-configure`). However, for security
we recommend you change the name and password of the Zope
administrator.

``zope_host``
  The name of the host that will run Zope. It defaults to the
  local machine (``127.0.0.1``).

``zope_port``
  The IP port that Zope will listen to. It defaults to ``8080``,
  and it recommended that you leave this value as-is, unless
  another service is running on port 8080. (Zope will have to run
  as ``root`` to use port 80, and this is discouraged; to use
  port 80 you will need to *proxy* GroupServer, see
  :doc:`proxy-configure`.)

``zope_admin``
  The name of the user who will administer Zope. This is used to
  log into the Zope Management Interface (ZMI).

``zope_password``
  The password for the Zope administrator. It can (and should) be
  changed after GroupServer has been set up.

.. note:: The IP-address of the ``zope_host`` and ``host`` (see
          `GroupServer site`_) must be the same.

Database storage
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

GroupServer stores most of its data in PostgreSQL_. Two passwords
need to be set by you to protect this data.

``pgsql_password``
  The password required to attach to the PostgreSQL database. The
  install system will create a PostgreSQL database, and protect
  it with this ``pgsql_password``.

``relstorage_password``
  `The RelStorage system`_ will store data in a PostgreSQL
  database for Zope. This data is protected by the
  ``relstorage_password``.

.. _the RelStorage system: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/RelStorage

.. index::
   single: PostgreSQL
   single: database
   pair: Configuration; PostgreSQL

Configure PostgreSQL
--------------------

`The RelStorage system`_ that is used by GroupServer requires
*prepared transaction* support to be enabled in PostgreSQL. To
enable prepared transaction support carry out the following
steps.

#. Edit the PostgreSQL configuration file. On Ubuntu you must be
   ``root`` to edit this file, which is located in
   :file:`/etc/postgresql/9.{x}/main/postgresql.conf`. (The actual
   directory name may be different depending on the version of
   PostgreSQL you have installed; change the ``9.{x}`` to match
   your version as appropriate.)

#. Find the line that reads

     .. code-block:: cfg

        max_prepared_transactions = 0

   If the line is set to something *other* than ``0`` then
   nothing needs to change, and you can `run the installer`_.

#. Change the line to read

     .. code-block:: cfg

        max_prepared_transactions = 1

#. Restart PostgreSQL. On Ubuntu this is done using the following
   command:

     .. code-block:: console

         $ sudo service postgresql restart

.. index::
   pair: Install; Build

Run the installer
=================

The installer for Ubuntu is a Bash script. (For `CentOS and
RHEL`_ you will have to carry out the steps by hand.) To run the
GroupServer installer enter the following command::

  $ ./gs_install_ubuntu.sh

You will be prompted for your password. This is required to check
that your Ubuntu system has met all the dependencies. Next the
installer ensures that the `set up`_ is correct.

:Permissions: GroupServer can only be run by users with normal
              privileges. If the installation directory is owned
              by ``root`` then you must **change the ownership**
              of the installation directory to a normal user and
              switch (``su``) to that user. Then run the
              installer.

The rest of the installation process should be completely
automatic.

* The system will create a *sandbox* for your GroupServer site,
  with its own version of Python, placed in ``./bin/``.

* It will then configure the PostgreSQL databases that store the
  data for your site.

* Finally, it will start the buildout [#buildout]_ system that
  will **download** and install all the requirements for
  GroupServer (around 47MB of packages) including:

  + `eGenix.com mx Base`_ (4.4MB)
  + `SQL Alchemy`_ (3.9MB)
  + lxml_ (3.4MB)
  + Pillow_ (2.4MB)
  + `Zope 2.13`_ (1.4MB)

  You need a functioning network connection to download the
  GroupServer requirements.

It is a good idea to make a cup of coffee, or go to lunch, while
buildout processes. The log file for the install will be written
to ``parts/log/{year}-{month}-{day}.{n}.log``.

CentOS and RHEL
---------------

The process to install GroupServer on CentOS or RedHat Enterprise
Linux is manual. The basic idea is as follows, but it lacks
testing.

.. note:: Commands that have to be run as ``root`` are shown on
          lines that begin with a ``#``. Commands that must be
          run as a normal user are shown on lines that begin with
          a ``$``.

#. Install the :ref:`dependencies`.

   :PostgreSQL: The version of PostgreSQL that is supplied with
                RHEL 6.x and CentOS 6.x (PostgreSQL 8.4) lacks
                the features required by GroupServer. You will
                need to install PostgreSQL 9, including the
                **development libraries** using `the instruction
                provided by the PostgreSQL project.`_

   :Python: The version of Python supplied with RHEL 6.x and
             CentOS 6.x (Python 2.6) lack the features required
             by GroupServer. You will need to install Python 2.7
             using `these instructions from H₂0.ai.`_

#. Create the two database users specified in :file:`config.cfg`,
   using :command:`createuser`:

     .. code-block:: console

        # createuser -D -S -R -l gsadmin
        # createuser -D -S -R -l gszodbadmin

#. Create the two databases specified in :file:`config.cfg` using
   :command:`createdb`:

     .. code-block:: console

        # createdb -Ttemplate0 -O gsadmin -EUTF-8 groupserver
        # createdb -Ttemplate0 -O gszodbadmin -EUTF-8 groupserverzodb

#. Get the Python ``virtualenv`` package:

     .. code-block:: console

        # easy_install virtualenv

#. Set up a Python virtual-environment for GroupServer:

     .. code-block:: console

        $ virtualenv --python=python2.7 --no-site-packages .

#. Activate the Python virtual-environment (**note** the
   dot-space at the start of the command):

     .. code-block:: console

         $ . bin/activate

#. Install the ``argparse`` module:

     .. code-block:: console

        $ pip install argparse==1.1

#. Fetch the `zc.buildout`_ system that builds GroupServer:

     .. code-block:: console

        $ pip install zc.buildout==2.3.1

#. Update ``setuptools``:

     .. code-block:: console

        $ pip install setuptools==18.0.1

#. :doc:`Bootstrap <README-buildout>` the installation:

     .. code-block:: console

        $ buildout bootstrap

#. Install the dependencies, which will take at least seven
   minutes:

     .. code-block:: console

        $ buildout install

#. Create your site:

     .. code-block:: console

        $ buildout -c site.cfg install

.. _the instruction provided by the PostgreSQL project.:
   http://www.postgresql.org/download/linux/redhat/

.. _these instructions from H₂0.ai.:

.. _zc.buildout: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/zc.buildout/

Start Zope
----------

Your GroupServer site is supported by Zope. To start Zope run the
following command:

.. code-block:: console

   $ ./bin/instance fg

Zope will have started when the message ``Zope Ready to handle
requests`` is displayed in the terminal.

You should be able to view your GroupServer site at
`http://{host}:{zope_port}`. If you kept the defaults, the
address will be <http://gstest:8080>.

* The host is the one you picked earlier (see `Pick a Host
  Name`_).
* The port is the one that site listens to (see `Configure
  GroupServer`_).

Use ``Control-c`` to stop Zope.

Next steps
----------

* :doc:`groupserver-start` has more information on running
  GroupServer, including running it as a **daemon.**

* The steps required to configure a **proxy** is documented in
  :doc:`proxy-configure`.

* We document the setup required to **receive email** with
  GroupServer in :doc:`postfix-configure`.

* Finally, we outline the steps required to send out the **daily
  digest of topics** in :doc:`cron`.
