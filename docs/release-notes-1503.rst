Introduction
------------

The major `changes to GroupServer`_ in the Rakı release include
the rebuilt email processing sub-system, the ability to export
posts, and internationalisation.  You can `get Rakı`_
immediately.

----------------------
Changes to GroupServer
----------------------

The most extensive change in Rakı is the new `email processing`_
subsystem. In addition GroupServer can now `export data`_, there
have been further `improvements to internationalisation`_, and
the introduction of `message relaying`_. Finally, there have been
some `minor code improvements`_.

.. _rebuilt email processing:

Email processing
================

The components that process email coming into a GroupServer
group, and sends email from the group, have been completely
changed. This update closes `Feature 387`_.

.. _Feature 387: https://redmine.iopen.net/issues/387

**Receiving email** is now handled by code that has been
thoroughly unit-tested to ensure that it works with multiple
character-sets and encodings. The **checks** to see if a message
should be processed have been refactored and are now much more
*extensible*, less *coupled*, and more *cohesive*, thanks to
`Bill Bushey`_.

The system for **building the email message** before it is sent
has been totally rebuilt. Now the message is created using
page-templates. This allows the techniques used to customise web
pages in GroupServer to be used to customise email messages,
including the *prologue* that appears at the top of every
message, and at the bottom the *file notifications* and the
*footer*.

The **headers** have been refactored to be more extensible. It is
now easy to add to the headers, and to change the behaviour of a
header. The :mailheader:`Reply-to` header, in particular, has
changed to allow the default behaviour of a group to change
between

* Reply to the group,
* Reply to the original author, and
* Reply to both.

Finally, the **sending** of an email from a group has been
tweaked. However, there *should* be no noticeable change.

Export data
===========

GroupServer has long had the ability to import profile data using
the *Add people in bulk* page, and import posts using the
``mbox2gs`` script. Now with the Rakı release GroupServer has the
ability to `export profiles`_ and `export posts`_.

.. index::
   pair: Profile; Export

Export profiles
---------------

The new *Export members* page allows an administrator to download
a CSV file of all the profile information of the group
members. The profile data is from the new ``profile.json`` view
of a profile. The new *Export members* page closes `Feature
4137`_.

.. _Feature 4137: https://redmine.iopen.net/issues/4137

.. index::
   pair: Email; Export

Export posts
------------

The new *Export posts* page allows an administrator to download
an ``mbox`` file containing the posts (with attachments) made to
a group in one particular month. By breaking the archive up like
this the administrator is able to download all the posts in the
most recent month and add it to an existing ``mbox`` archive of
posts. The new *Export posts* page closes `Feature 3594`_.

.. _Feature 3594: https://redmine.iopen.net/issues/3594

.. index:: Internationalisation, i18n

Improvements to internationalisation
====================================

The effort by `Alice Rose`_ to improve internationalisation
support in GroupServer continues apace. GroupServer is now using
Transifex_ to manage the translations. **You can add
translations,** without needing to know any Python or HTML!

.. _Transifex: https://www.transifex.com/organization/groupserver/

All the major components of GroupServer have internationalisation
support. This includes the site homepage, the group page, the
topic page, and the post page. Adding internationalisation
support to the bulk of GroupServer closes `Bug 81`_.

.. _Bug 81: https://redmine.iopen.net/issues/81

The translation effort is currently focused on French, German,
and Spanish (with English being the default language). French is
has the most complete localisation, thanks to the amazing efforts
of `Razique Mahroua`_.

.. _Razique Mahroua: https://www.transifex.com/accounts/profile/Razique/

Finally there is now a :doc:`translations` included in the
GroupServer_ documentation. Adding the new internalisation
documentation closes `Feature 4031`_.

.. _Feature 4031: https://redmine.iopen.net/issues/4031

.. index::
   pair: Email; DMARC

Message relaying
================

Messages sent from a GroupServer group can fall afoul of
email-servers that enforce DMARC_ policies. To overcome this
GroupServer rewrites the :mailheader:`From` address: when
necessary it replaces the :mailheader:`From` address with one
constructed from the unique identifier of the profile of the
author. This new address is known as the **obfuscated address**
(see :doc:`release-notes-1406`).

However, the rewritten :mailheader:`From` address has made it
difficult to reply the author of the message — and this was
particularly problematic when the default :mailheader:`Reply-to`
for the group set to the *author* rather than the *group* .

Now, thanks to the work by `Bill Bushey`_ GroupServer will now
relay on messages that are sent to an obfuscated address, closing
`Feature 4106`_.

.. _DMARC: https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc7489
.. _Feature 4106: https://redmine.iopen.net/issues/4106

Minor code improvements
=======================

* The XML for the *Email settings* page has been updated.
* The CSS that is used in the notifications has been fixed.
* The code that makes up the *Topics* list on the group page, the
  *Topic* and *topic digests* has been refactored, closing
  `Feature 3739`_.
* The ``+`` character (and others) can now be used in email
  addresses, closing `Bug 3915`_ and `Bug 4036`_.

.. _Feature 3739: https://redmine.iopen.net/issues/3739
.. _Bug 3915: https://redmine.iopen.net/issues/3915
.. _Bug 4036: https://redmine.iopen.net/issues/4036

Get Rakı
--------

To get Rakı go to `the Downloads page for GroupServer`_ and
follow `the GroupServer Installation documentation`_. Those who
already have a functioning installation can `update an existing
GroupServer system`_.

..  _The Downloads page for GroupServer: http://groupserver.org/downloads
..  _The GroupServer Installation documentation:
    http://groupserver.readthedocs.io/

Update an Existing GroupServer System
=====================================

To update a system running the Calvados release of GroupServer
(14.11) to Rakı (15.03) carry out the following steps.

#.  Download the Rakı tar-ball from `the GroupServer download
    page <http://groupserver.org/downloads>`_.

#.  Uncompress the tar-ball::

      $ tar cfz groupserver-15.03.tar.gz

#.  Change to the directory that contains your existing
    GroupServer installation.

#.  Copy the new version-configuration files to your existing
    GroupServer installation::

      $ cp ../groupserver-15.03/[bdiv]*cfg  .

#.  In your **existing** GroupServer installation copy the
    configuration file to its new location.

    #.  Make an ``etc`` directory::

          $ mkdir etc/

    #.  Move the configuration file to the new directory::

          $ cp parts/instance/etc/gsconfig.ini etc/

#.  Run ``buildout`` in your existing GroupServer installation::

      $ ./bin/buildout -N

#.  Restart your GroupServer instance (see
    :doc:`groupserver-start`).
