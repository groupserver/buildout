GroupServer uses a year-month version number (``yy.mm``). What
would be termed Version 1 with `semantic version numbers`_, the
`Frozen treats`_ series, corresponds to the releases from
:doc:`release-notes-1009` up to and including
:doc:`release-notes-1205` [#alpha]_.

Currently, GroupServer could be considered in Version 2
since the release of :doc:`release-notes-1211`, which marked the
start of the `Awesome aperitifs`_ series.
