This is GroupServer_: a mailing-list manager with an excellent
integrated web interface.

* If you are looking at this ``README`` in a directory, then the
  directory contains all the necessary information for
  downloading and installing_ GroupServer. The system will be run
  from a Python virtual-environment that is created in this
  folder.

* If you are looking at the repository_ on GitHub, then this is
  what goes into a release of GroupServer.

Installing
==========

An up-to-date version of installation documentation is
available from `Read the Docs`_, and a copy of the installation
instructions that were current when this version of GroupServer
was packaged is in the ``docs`` directory.

.. _GroupServer: http://groupserver.org/
.. _Read the Docs: http://groupserver.readthedocs.org/

The documentation for GroupServer can be generated by installing
Sphinx_ and running ``make`` in the ``docs`` directory:

.. code-block:: console

    $  virtualenv --python=python2.7 .
    $ . ./bin/activate
    $ pip install Sphinx
    $ cd docs
    $ make html

The HTML documentation will be written to the ``_build/html``
folder.

.. _Sphinx: http://sphinx-doc.org/

Repository
==========

`The repository on GitHub`_ is named ``buildout`` because it uses
`zc.buildout`_ to download and install all the components that
make up the system. A release of GroupServer is little more than
the contents of the repository in a tar-ball [#hggit]_:

.. code-block:: console

   $ hg archive -p groupserver-{yy}.{mm} -ttgz -X ".hg*" \
     groupserver-{yy}.{mm}.tar.gz

.. _The repository on GitHub:
   https://github.com/groupserver/buildout
.. _zc.buildout: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/zc.buildout/

.. [#hggit] Assuming that `Hg-Git`_ is used.
.. _Hg-Git: http://hg-git.github.io/
